    \subsection{Focus Question}
        How does the weight connected to a gravity car affect the distance it
        travels

    \subsection{Hypothesis}
        The weight will linearly affect the distance travelled by the gravity
        car

    \subsection{Theory}
        Let $A$ the point at which the car starts, $B$ the point at which at the weight
        touches the base of the car, and $C$ the point at which the car stops. Also, let $M$
        the mass of the whole car, $m$ the mass of the weight attached to the car, $h$ the
        height from which the height is dropped, $r$ the radius of the wheels, $r_a$ the
        radius of the axle attached to the wheels, and $m_w$ the mass of one of the wheels.

        The distance $AB$ depends on $h$, $r$, and $r_a$. When the weight falls by $h$, the
        axle will rotate by the same angular displacement $\theta$ as the wheels, 
        \begin{align*}
            AB = \frac{r}{r_a} h
        \end{align*}

        Next, the distance $BC$ depends on the velocity $v_B$ with which the car reaches
        $B$ as well as the friction $f$ which is applied to the car. 

        Ignoring the energy lost to heat, by conservation of mechanical energy,
        \begin{align*}
            \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}(M+m)v_B^2}_{\text{Translational Kinetic Energy of Car}} +
            \underbrace{4\cdot\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2}_{\text{Rotational Kinetic Energy of Wheels}} &=
            \underbrace{mgh}_{\text{Gravitational Potential Energy of Weight}}
        \end{align*}

        The moment of inertia of each wheel is $\frac{1}{2}m_wr^2$, and the angular velocity
        of each wheel is $\frac{u_b}{r}$. Substituting these values gives:
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{1}{2}(M+m)u_B^2 + 2I\omega^2                          &= mgh \Rightarrow \\
            \frac{1}{2}(M+m)u_B^2 + 2\frac{1}{2}m_wr^2(\frac{u_b}{r})^2 &= mgh \Rightarrow \\
            \frac{1}{2}(M+m)u_B^2 + \frac{1}{r^2}u_b^2 &= mgh
        \end{align*}

        Solving for $u_B$, this becomes:
        \begin{align*}
            u_B = \sqrt{\frac{2mgh}{M+m_w+m}}
        \end{align*}

        Then, $BC$ will equal $\frac{u_B^2}{2a_f}$ where $a_f$ is the acceleration of the
        car due to friction. $a_f$ equals $\frac{\mu M g}{M} = \mu g$, So, 
        \begin{align*}
            BC &= \dfrac{u_B^2}{2a_f} = \dfrac{\dfrac{2mgh}{M+m_w+m}}{2\mu g}
                                     = \dfrac{mh}{\mu(M+m_w+m)} \\
               &= \frac{h\cdot \mathbf{m}}{\mu(M+m_w) + \mu \cdot \textbf{m}}
        \end{align*}

        The complete distance covered $S=AB+BC$ covered by the car will, therefore be: 
        \begin{framed}
            \begin{equation} \label{eq:s_formula}
            \begin{aligned}
                S = \frac{r}{r_a}h + \frac{h\cdot \mathbf{m}}{\mu(M+m_w) + \mu \cdot \textbf{m}}
            \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}
        \end{framed}
        This means that the distance covered by the car will continuously increase with $m$,
        asymptotically approaching $\frac{r}{r_a}h + \frac{h}{\mu}$

            \item Leego pieces (for making the gravity car)
            \item Measured weights and weight holder
            \item String

        \subsubsection{Conducting the Experiment}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Hang weight from string
                \item Roll string on the axis until weight is at the height of the
                    mark
                \item Place car around 40cm from the sensor with an object to
                    prevent it from moving. The exact distance does not matter since
                    we are only measuring the distance travelled. It must be more
                    than 40 cm, however, since that is the minimum distance the
                    sensor can measure.  
                \item Start the logger
                \item Remove the object so the car starts moving
                \item When the car has completely stopped, stop the logger and
                    record the data
            \end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental Report}
    \subsection{Modifications to the original design}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Because of the weight continuously falling off the car, a small
            amount of plasticine was added to the base of the car which would
            catch the weight.

        \item When the weight reached the base of the car, the string would
            start rolling up on the axis, stopping the car when it got fully
            stretched. The solution was to simply use a much longer piece of
            string. This had the side-effect of sometimes getting tangled up on
            the axle, however, all measurements in which that happened were
            discarded.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Data Processing}
        \subsubsection{Overview}
            For processing the data, I will graph the relationship of the weight
            on the gravity car to the mean distance travelled in the five
            measurements with that weight. The error for each measurement is
            calculated as half the difference between the greatest and the least
            measurement, or: ${\Delta \bar{s} = \frac{1}{2}(s_{max} - s_{min})}$. 
            The data will then be added to the program graph, which will allow
            us to derive a best-fit function for the data.

    \subsection{Conclusion \& Evaluation}
        \subsubsection{Conclusion \& Justification}
        \subsubsection{Evaluating Procedures \& Suggestions for Improvements}
            While the data gathered were fairly precise, there was a variety of
            possible improvements that could have further increased that
            precision:
        
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The way that the height from which the weight fell was
                    measured was by having a small mark on the tower of the
                    gravity car, and  lining that mark up with the base of the
                    weight each time. This method was, of course, very
                    error-prone since lining up the weight with the mark was
                    done completely manually. In order to improve the
                    consistency of the fall height, a ruler or some other
                    straight object could have been used to ensure that the
                    weight fell exactly from the mark each time

                \item The plasticine, while effective in preventing the weight
                    from falling over and stopping the car, did introduce
                    another uncertainty into the experiment. On each iteration,
                    the fall of the weight would slightly deform the plasticine,
                    meaning that on the next iteration, the weight would have a
                    slightly different distance to travel, by a few millimeters. 

                \item It was observed after the completion of the experiment
                    that the floor on which the experiment was conducted was
                    tilted against the direction on which the car was
                    travelling. While this incline did certainly affect the
                    distance that the car travelled on each individual
                    measurement, the fact that the incline was constant and that
                    the car was, for all measurements, travelling in the same
                    direction, meant that it most likely did not affect the
                    overall behaviour of the distance travelled by the car
                    relative to the weight used. 
            \end{itemize}
